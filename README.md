# Pong_Game
This is a basic pong game programmed in the java language against a CPU. It is a basic demonstration of my skills and familiarity with Object Oriented Programming and its principles. 

To control the paddle, the user holds the W key down to move up and the S key down to move down. 

Technology used:
- Java
- Swing Library
- Eclipse IDE
- Event Listeners
